# Data Abstraction & Problem Solving with C++

This repository contains corrected and enhanced code examples from the textbook "Data Abstraction & Problem Solving with C++: Walls and Mirrors." The original textbook, while an excellent resource for learning data structures and C++, contains several syntax errors in its code examples. These errors can hinder understanding and progress, especially for readers new to data structures or the C++ programming language.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to provide error-free versions of the textbook's code examples and solutions to the challenges it presents. This effort not only aids in personal preparation for coding interviews but also deepens the understanding of data structures and algorithms. By correcting these examples, I aim to create a more accessible and beneficial resource for anyone looking to reinforce their knowledge of C++ and data structures.

## Contents

- **Corrected Code Examples:** Each chapter's examples are revised to eliminate syntax errors, ensuring they compile and run as intended.
- **Challenge Solutions:** Solutions to end-of-chapter challenges are provided, offering additional practice and insight.
- **Supplementary Notes:** Where applicable, additional notes and explanations are included to clarify concepts and implementation details.
